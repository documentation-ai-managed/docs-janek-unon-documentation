## Document Structures

You build documentation using a tree-like structure of pages and subpages. Each page starts with YAML frontmatter for metadata, followed by MDX content. Nest sections with headings and use components like `<Callout>` for emphasis.

For example, create a sidebar navigation by organizing files in directories:

```
docs/
  ├── core-concepts.mdx
  └── workflows/
      ├── collaboration.mdx
      └── versioning.mdx
```

<Callout kind="tip">
  Use consistent naming conventions like `kebab-case.mdx` for predictable navigation.
</Callout>

```

## Versioning Basics

Track document history automatically. Each edit creates a new version with diffs.

<CodeGroup tabs="CLI,API">
  ```bash
  # List versions
  janek versions core-concepts.mdx
  
  # Checkout version
  janek checkout core-concepts.mdx v1.2.0
  ```
  ```javascript
  // Fetch version history
  const versions = await janek.api.getVersions('core-concepts.mdx');
  console.log(versions[0].diff);
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Restore previous states easily:

```javascript
// Example diff output
{
  "added": ["New collaboration step"],
  "removed": ["Old workflow note"],
  "author": "alice@example.com",
  "timestamp": "2024-10-15T10:00:00Z"
}
```

These features ensure your documentation remains organized, collaborative, and reliable.
